# NOTE! This Is MY Code, Nothing Here Is Stolen Or Leaked

## Since This No Longer Counts Towards Our Grade, I Have No Issue Putting Something Like This Out Here

# Features

* Automatic creation of required files and folders as set out in brief (DOES NOT include questions and answers files). Lets the user choose the folders name
* All directories automatically retrieved and assigned so no messing about if you're not compiling and it'll work fine if you are
* Automatic writing to files containing user information
* Working login system
* Subject and difficulty choice
* Read questions and answers from text files
* Reading of said questions and answers automatic and simple via a simple Do loop and function that will read the answers and questions automatically
* Exports formatted logs of grade, score, percentage and other user information (Not very elegant code right now)
* Allows the user to restart the quiz, change subject etc at the end of the quiz
* Automatic triggering of a fix if the users folder (Where questions and accounts are stored) if it isn't found.
* Code that you don't have to touch at all! i think :)

# Extras READ!
* You have to create an 'answers.txt' and 'questions.txt' for each subject and difficulty. I know it's tedious but you're getting this code for free ya lazy bastard
* When creating questions/answers, you should start on the third line down and then write your next line 2 lines down. Repeat this for each question

## Example
Line 1: Empty

Line 2: Empty

Line 3: WRITE

Line 4: Empty

Line 5: WRITE

Line 6: Empty

Line 7: WRITE

# Final Words
This code probably isn't the best or even close to the best out there, but hey it works, it'll **probably** get you a good mark for the code and it's a lot fucking better than just creating 15 if statements inside of each other. Which is what my whole class is doing. I mean it works but ew.
